\section*{Introduction}
During our project our main goal was to introduce a new way to handle multi touch events and gesture in Pharo.
Starting from what we previously did in last semester during the PJE lecture, we used the same approach to
introduce a handling of gestures based on TUIO with an architecture allowing to switch to VM events.

Another goal was to clean and reunify the whole hierarchy of system events and to provide a clean abstraction
of low level data structure.
